The following file provides a brief overview of the classes used in the project:


RunFile.java: main code file, initialising all data structures and runing all the desired codes;

Read_SQL.java: read information from SQL data base and sort it according the designated data structrure;

Object.java:class structure with voltage, angle, time and substration ID;

Point.java: array of objects describing the grid, in this case it is comprised of 9 objects due to the existing 9 buses;

Initialize.java:randomize centroids and assign closest point to these centroids;

k_means_clustering.java: run k-means algorithm, relocating the centroid positioning based on the points from data acquired;

labeling_clusters.java: label each cluster based on certain conditions described in the report annexed;

k_nearest_neighbor.java: run kNN algorithm for the testing set comprised of the analog_values from SQL database;

NOT USED:
standardization: procedure to standardise data due to large discrepancy in voltage angle and magnitude values, which
ended up not beign used because the same result was achieved and it would require either conversion to the non-standardize
data to label it correctly or double the memory usage;
